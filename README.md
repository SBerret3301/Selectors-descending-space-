Explanation:

1. `li`: This CSS selector targets top-level list items (`<li>`) in an unordered list (`<ul>`) and applies a circle list style to them.

   - `list-style-type: circle;`: Sets the list style type to a circle for the top-level list items.

2. `li li`: This CSS selector targets nested list items (`<li>`) within an unordered list (`<ul>`) and applies a disc list style to them.

   - `list-style-type: disc;`: Sets the list style type to a disc for the nested list items.

The HTML document contains an unordered list with list items, and each list item has a `<div>` element as part of its content. The CSS styles are applied to control the list styles for the top-level and nested list items. The comments in the code provide explanations for each section.
